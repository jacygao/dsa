# Divide and Conquer

Break a big problem into sub-problems. Then solve each sub-problem and combine the solution of each sub-problem to get the final solution for the main problem.

Solution to Sub-problems should be the same as solution to the main problems. For example, if the solution to the main problem is sorting, then the solution to the sub-problems must be sorting as well.

## Use Cases

- Binary Search
- Find maximum and minimum
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

## Techniques

### Recursion

Divide and Conquer solutions are natually implemented as recursive procedures

## Time Complexity

Given that Divide and Conquer is commonly used by Merge Sort and Quick Sort, typically the time complexity is `O(nlog(n))`.
